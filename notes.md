Better Ideas For the future:

The API would have been easier to fetch using serializers.

I would create the User object within the form and have it relate to the Sign table with the sign_id given.

This would have required:

1. adding gem 'fast_jsonapi' to the gemfile
2. running 'rails g serializer User' & 'rails g serializer Sign'
3. updating controller actions for any of the methods avaiable like index or show
    
    class UsersController < ApplicationController

        def index
            users = User.all
            render json: UserSerializer.new(users)

        end
  
        def show
            user = User.find(params[:id])
            render json: UserSerializer.new(user)
        end

    end

    ASIDE: Serializers generated by the Fast JSON API gem have two built-in methods called serializable_hash and serialized_json which return a serialized hash and a JSON string respectively. However, we don't actually need either of these in this example, as to_json will still be called on SightingSerializer.new(sighting) implicitly. As we will see, once our serializers are configured and initialized, we will not need to do any additional work

    - add wanted attributes in the user_serializer.rb and sign_serializer.rb files
    - add relationships underneath the attributes so you don't really have control over what attributes are included in the related objects
    - include the second 'options' arguments within the index and show methods above
    like this:

    class UsersController < ApplicationController

        def index
            users = User.all
            options = { include: [:sign] }
            render json: UserSerializer.new(users, options)

        end
  
        def show
            user = User.find(params[:id])
            options = { include: [:sign] }
            render json: UserSerializer.new(user, options)
        end

    end
